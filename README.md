# Title - Carbon Footprint Calculator
A web-based application that helps users calculate and visualize their carbon footprint based on energy consumption, travel, habits, and daily lifestyle choices.
The project aims to promote environmental awareness and provide actionable insights for reducing personal emissions.

# Project Overview
This application is built using **Streamlit** for the frontend **Supabase** for secure authentication and data storage. Users can log in, input their lifestyle data, 
and get estimated carbon emissions visualized with charts and summaries.

*Note: This project is currently in development. New features and modules will be added soon.*

## Tech Stack
-**Frontend/UI:** Streamlit
-**Backend:** Python
-**Authentication/Database:** Supabase
-**Libraries Used :** Pandas, Streamlit, Plotly/ Matplotlib
-**Version Control:** Git & Github


## Features
- User register and login using Supabase authentication
- Interactive streamlit interface for data entry and visualization
- Carbon emission estimation based on activity data(e.g., transport , electricity, food)
- Dynamic charts, showing emission distributon
- Modular and scalable backend code
- (Upcoming) Personalized recommendations for emissions reduction
